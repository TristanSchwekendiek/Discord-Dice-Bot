This is a project I made as a fun personal project.  I needed a way to roll dice effectively and efficiently, so I designed this bot to roll dice with as few steps as possible.

Example Usage:

As shown in the above image, simply use the prefix '!' followed by the number and type of dice you wish to roll.  If you leave the number in from of 'd' blank, it will be treated as one dice.  You can string together these expressions by using the '+' symbol.  Adding '+' and then a number will add the number to the roll total.  The order of the expressions does not affect the outcome.
